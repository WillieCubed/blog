# Lab Logs Overview

Lab Logs is a collection of things I do each day in lab. Each day I do lab work,
its log will contain:

- A one-sentence TL;DR of the day's events
- Research goals I attempted to address
- Tasks I completed
- Unresolved things
- Questions I came up with during the day

It is my hope that I will be able to measure my progress throughout the summer
using these Lab Logs and celebrate everything I've done.
