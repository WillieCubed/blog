# Hello World, Etc., Etc.
**July 22, 2019, 7:49 AM CDT**

Yeah, it's about time I actually started one of these.

Something about accountability and actually keeping track of what I program
each day. What better way to ensure accountability than to store logs of what
I do each day in an almost-immutable graph of hashes? Well, maybe blockchain,
but we don't use that word around here.

Also, I heard that this will greatly aid me in a potential job search because
it's the start of a portfolio and whatnot. Oh boy, so much to build, and so
little time to do it.

I'll have to mess with the templates for this thing because I want this to fit
my personality and whatnot but not right now because I have more pressing 
projects to complete *cough* my poster project for the 2019 Clark Summer
Research Program *cough*.

In any case, thanks for listening. Let's build something great together, or at
least have me make many things and have others watch all the failures build into
one success.
