  I'm going to start a blog and talk about what I'm building. I'll make sure this lasts a while...
  I promise. Again. No seriously, fifth time's the charm.

Last time I tried to maintain a blog, I thought I was going to produce
meaningful research during the summer. Oh, boy.

Here's the bet this time around: I will post something - read: **anything of value** -
every day by 11:59 PM CST for the forseeable future in another effort to
remain accountable in the long term.

This will function primarily as my developer blog in which I share the
highlights of what I'm working on - not just funny code snippets that ruined my
day, but also design decisions behind many of the choices I make for my projects
explained to a layman (or something close to that).

In typical Willie fashion, tomorrow I'll explain more about my goals for this
project (since everything I go is a project, after all).

Until tomorrow,
A kid who likes learning the hard way
