# A Memorable Summer
A few years ago, back in my more amateur high school developer days, I attempted
the #100DaysOfCode challenge in an effort to rapidly learn and understand how
to make code do my bidding.

This is that challenge, reincarated, but on steroids.

This memorable summer will be one filled with lots of reading documentation,
scanning blog posts, and diving into research papers.

Instead of merely programming and implementing solutions to contrived problems,
I will be doing that *and* documenting what I learn along the way.

As we all know, naming things is the Achilles heel of any CS major, and I am no
exception to that observation. This is why I am naming this initiative
**The Summer of Stuff**.

# What I Want
**TL;DR: This initiative is more a hard set of recommendations than a script.**

The Summer of Stuff will be filled with software development on a scale the
likes in which I have never participated.

## Goals
1. **Encourage rapid, iterative development.**
  I have historically struggled to launch or deploy projects to production,
  often times getting stuck in the nitty-gritty of interesting configuration
  options for a particular software library or outright putting the cart before
  the horse in terms of how I build my projects. Sometimes, progress isn't
  obvious; however, this isn't one of those times. With the Summer of Stuff,
  I will be forced to build in a way that makes my progress clearly evident
  to someone with limited knowledge about a specific project.
2. **Encourage succinct technical and layman communication.**
  Of course, this doesn't mean I won't use humor to communicate my findings or
  project developments. I will however, focus on expressing the core ideas of my
  projects, whether it's design motivations or specific implementation 
  As I have time during the summer, I would prefer to dedicate around 15-30
  minutes writing up a detailed report than piecing together something that
  would not make sense to anyone other than myself.

## Non-Goals
1. ***Really* documenting my projects.** Despite a small amount of interest
  from my end (meaning me), I won't turn this specific initiative into anything
  other than a text-based blog.
  Perhaps I may do so during the upcoming academic year once I've finalized my
  day-to-day schedule; however, I would prefer to actually finish something
  during the summer. Therefore, I will not spend time documenting my projects
  through something like a vlog or other forms of social media.

# My Deliverables
Every day by 11:59 PM CDT (likely earlier because I want to sleep by 10 PM), I
will publish a minimum of one blog post documenting my progress for the day in
whatever I build. This post will be at least 150 words in length and focus
exclusively on one project.

As an optional bonus, I may publish an additional blog post detailing some
brilliant concept or idea that deserves more than a mere project update.
These may vary wlidly in length or in subject matter.

The Summer of Stuff begins May 12, 2020 and ends August 16, 2020, the day before
classes resume for the fall 2020 semester.


# The Future
I desire for this initiative to lead to a more long-term presence online in
which I consistently share my progress towards whatever project I find myself
building.

In July, I will be participating in my own challenge - a sub-initiative of the
Summer of Stuff - the Month of ML, in which the entire month is dedicated to
implementing - not just applying - the algorithms that are used in AI in an
effort to prepare myself for research ahead.

I'll just have to plan it later. Let's see if I can make it to then.


Until later,

A dude with high hopes
