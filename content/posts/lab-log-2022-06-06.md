# TL;DR

I downloaded some datasets and got ~~Facebook~~ Meta AI's MDETR model running.

# Today's Research Goals

- Actually start taining the MDETR model.

# Completed Tasks

- I was able to run a script to start the MDETR model training.

# Unresolved Things

[None]

# Questions From Today

- What do these benchmarks measure, exactly?
- Why is there no standard for code for ML models?

# Other Notes

I am very much digging this mechanical keyboard provided by my lab. Before
joining this lab, I could not see what the fuss was about. Now, I think I'll
purchase a mechanical keyboard of my own once I have the funds (and a dedicated
desktop of my own).

I have also forgotten just how powerful it is to have a machine that accepts inputs
faster than you can type and that does not crash every few hours. I want a new
laptop.

Also, remind me never to copy-paste a configuration file from the web into Vim
again.
